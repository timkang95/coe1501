// Assignment 1 Reorder interface
// Carefully read the specifications for the methods below and
// implement them in your MultiDS class.  As with the PrimQ
// interface, don't worry as much about efficiency here as you do
// about correctness.

public interface Reorder
{
	// Logically reverse the data in the Reorder object so that the item
	// that was logically first will now be logically last and vice
	// versa.  The physical implementation of this can be done in 
	// many different ways, depending upon how you actually implemented
	// your physical MultiDS class
	public void reverse();

	// Remove the logical last item of the DS and put it at the 
	// front.  As with reverse(), this can be done physically in
	// different ways depending on the underlying implementation.  
	public void shiftRight();

	// Remove the logical first item of the DS and put it at the
	// end.  As above, this can be done in different ways.
	public void shiftLeft();
	
	public void shuffle();
	// Reorganize the items in the object in a pseudo-random way.  The exact
	// way is up to you but it should utilize a Random object (see Random in 
	// the Java API)
